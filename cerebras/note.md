# What did I do:

## What ALCF suggested to do:
[ALCF suggests](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/ai-testbed/cerebras/customizing-environment/) to use and/or install cerebras_pytorch==2.4.0, but cerebras-modelzoo requires cerebras_pytorch==2.5.0, so that does not work.
And it seems that 2.5.0 is already installed?
